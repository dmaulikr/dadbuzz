Family app for kids.

I often received many txt messages from my wife asking when I'm leaving work, am I in the car yet, how far away am I... lots of messages and updates.

So I wrote this simple app to not have to open the phone a tones of times and type a response to my wife.

All you do is press a button with pre-recorded audio messages. Used a push notification to trigger them on the wife phone.

Added bonus is when the kids hear the message they get super excited... ha ha...

Note: record your messgae with you kids so when they hear it, they lose it with excitement
