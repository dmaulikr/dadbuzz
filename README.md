Family app for kids.

I often received many txt messages from my wife asking when I'm leaving work, am I in the car yet, how far away am I away... lots of messages and updates. lol.. Having to open the phone all the time became a pain the neck.

I wrote this simple app so I would have to type text message our anymore.

All you do is press a button with pre-recorded audio messages then send a push notification to trigger them on the wifeâ€™s phone.

Note: record your messages with your kids so when they hear it, they lose it with excitement.

App uses Parse, you'd need to find a different backend such as Urban Airship because Parse no longer exists.
